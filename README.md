# terminal-chat Lite Version
- now allow multiple chat
- but lots more lighter
- also lots of stablility
- need to run ServerForm.jar first
- still have some bugs with local command (#) that need no parameter
- secondary server may be added

HOW TO USE
1. Start server first by open package.Server.ServerForm.jar
2. Start clients by open package.Client.ClientForm.jar
3. If it connected properly there will be a pop-up dialogbox informs you.
4. Type in textfield at bottom of the frame and hit Return(aka. Enter) key to send message.
5. In case of using local command you need to type in a pattern like this(without single quote) '#<command> <param>'.
6. local command
  #create <group name>  |   create group
  #join <group name>    |   join group (If the group doesn't exist, programe will generate autometically.)
  #hostname <name>      |   change your displayed name
  #enter <group name>   |   join group (Only if you used to join that group and never left before)
  #leave                |   permanently quit current group chat
  #mute                 |   mute current group chat for a while*
